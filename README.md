An app to generate new boxes in your app. And move those boxes using your keyboard keys.

# Run the app

Run `npm install` to download the dependencies
Run `ng serve` and the project will run at `http://localhost:4200/box-generator`.

# Use the box generator

Create a box using `Add Box` Button and the boxes will be created in a boundary and you can use your keys to move these boxes
    W -> UP
    S -> DOWN
    A -> LEFT
    D -> RIGHT

The new box will always overlap the previous boxes.
